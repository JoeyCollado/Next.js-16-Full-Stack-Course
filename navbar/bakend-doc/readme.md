# Database - to store content
# Auth - to authenticate users, also enforced auth wall for users to be able to create
# ORM - convert typescript code into sql, so we use typescript syntax not sql for this context of nextjs project
# S3 - file uploads, like image
# Vector DB - for search function
# ACID Transactions - optimize website speed

(these two will be connected)
# Tanstack Query - to fetch, mutate data
# API Layer (oRPC)
